# QMaxUSE Project

## QMaxUSE is a query-based language designed for selection of UML class diagram features.
### These features include:
### * Classes
### * Attributes
### * Associations
### * Invariants

## QMaxUSE is integrated with [MaxUSE](https://github.com/classicwuhao/maxuse), a modeling tool.

### More to come very soon!

I thank Hao Wu ([@classicwuhao](https://github.com/classicwuhao)) for giving me the opportunity to work on this project.
